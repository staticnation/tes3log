In the time of the Prophet Veloth, the Nords invaded our lands and drove us out of the good places. Later we grew strong and cunning, and we came down and slew them, and took our land back. Since then, we have kept our land free of the Nords, but they are always scheming to return and steal our good places.|SCVR:0CsX0nolore|INTV:|BNAM:;Ashlanders
