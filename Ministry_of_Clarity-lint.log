  |DATA|ONAM:svenja_outside|NAME:The winds have whispered to me, %PCName. They have told me of your failure to enter Hrothmund's Barrow. In order to become chieftain of Thirsk, you needed to enter the barrow and grasp the axe of Hrothmund to receive his blessing. Now, that will never happen. This is a sad day. I fear Thirsk will never reopen.|SCVR:04JX0BM_Airship_a|INTV: |BNAM:Journal BM_Airship_c 20  Goodbye

  |DATA|CNAM:Miner|ANAM:Dissapla Mine|NAME:Smuggling raw glass is a crime. All raw glass belongs to the Emperor, so it's the crime of treason, and punished by death. But... there's so much money to be made selling black market raw glass that it's a rare merchant who'll refuse to buy a piece from you. Of course, if the mine guards catch you stealing raw glass, they just kill you. Which is why we don't steal raw glass.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:

[DUP-INF]: ID=2076565943043228859(Topic:great houses)
  |DATA|ONAM:huleeya|NAME:In modern times Morrowind is ruled by five Great Houses: House Hlaalu, House Redoran, House Telvanni, House Indoril, and House Dres. Great Houses culture is partly defined by its roots in ancient Dunmer tribal clans, and partly by later Imperial  influences from other Western cultures. The Great Houses culture is only one of the native Dunmer cultures of Morrowind. The other native culture, the Ashlander culture, is a nomadic barbarian culture largely untouched by Imperial influences.|SCVR:34JX3A1_7HuleeyaInformant|INTV
