  morrowind.esm------------>|DATA|CNAM:Commoner|NAME:I am a commoner. I do whatever needs doing -- cooking, cleaning, building, baking, making, breaking. And, by your accent, I can tell YOU are an outlander. Since you're new to these parts, perhaps you'd like me to share a little local lore.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Commoner; Morrowind lore, local lore
  CurioPortrait_Static.esp->|DATA|CNAM:Commoner|NAME:I set the table and tidy things up for parties. It's a very demanding job, actually, especially at the Curio manor. Everything has to look just so, depending on the type of occasion. Recently Councilor Curio has directed me to examine his portrait and reflect its "sensuous ambiance" in my placement of the cutlery. I'm not exactly sure what he meant by that...|BNAM:;Commoner; Morrowind lore, local lore
