  morrowind.esm---->|DATA|ONAM:dulnea ralaal|NAME:Good day. I'm Dulnea Ralaal, publican of the Eight Plates here in Balmora. We rent beds, and I have a limited selection of goods for barter.

  tribunal.esm----->|DATA|FNAM:Fighters Guild|NAME:You like to poke your nose into doors out in the backcountry? A little suggestion. The places that look like they're made of a golden metal? With spires and towers? Those are Dwarven ruins. They're kinda dangerous -- partly because of the old Dwarven machines in them, and partly because of the kind of things that like to hide out in such old ruins. All the old ruins inside the Ghostfence, for example, are ancient Dwarven ruins. And I hear that vampires like them, too.|SCVR:02sX4Random100|INTV|SCVR:1CsX0nolore|INTV:
