  morrowind.esm------------------------->|DATA|ONAM:elam andas|NAME:The helm and cuirass are heavy armor, and useful only to a strong fighter. These items belonged to one of the Ordinators who were killed, and it is fitting that they should reward the one who avenged his murder. However, we ask that you not wear this armor in Vivec City, for you may be mistaken for an Ordinator and guard. Alternatively, the Belt of the Armor of God provides magical armor and improves resistance against hostile spells, and should be useful for any adventurer. Which would you like?|SCVR:01500|INTV|BNAM:;Elam Andas: CHOICE 3;   Choice "I'd like the helm and cuirass." 4 "I'd like the belt." 5
  EvenMoreMysteriousKillingsinVivec.ESP->|DATA|ONAM:elam andas|NAME:Since I am not allowed to use Order assets to compensate freelancers, I would be happy to give you this personal gift of an old helmet and cuirass of mine or this Belt of the Armor of God which provides magical armor and improves resistance against hostile spells, and should be useful for any adventurer. Which would you like?|SCVR:01500|INTV|BNAM:;Elam Andas: CHOICE 3;   Choice "I'd like the helm and cuirass." 4 "I'd like the belt." 5
