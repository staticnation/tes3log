I might be able to pressure Cunius Pelelius if I had proof of his misdeeds. Olumba says the slaves in the mine would know, but they'll be afraid to talk. Perhaps I can persuade them....

I've never known the things to travel in such large numbers, and there were a lot of these things. I've also never heard of werewolves on this island. Who knows, though. I've heard rumors that the Nords up north can control the beasts, though. Some say they can even turn into them. Whatever they were, I don't want to see them again.
