Her lover, Variner, was killed by the Black Dart Gang in the Temple Sewers, and now his ghost comes to her at night, begging her to rescue him. The ghost says he has a message for her, but she is afraid to go further.  She says the Black Dart Gang are very dangerous. They dress like poor beggars, but they throw deadly poison darts -- one is enough to kill you. I offered to help, but she thinks I should run if I see the Black Dart Gang.

A master of speechcraft understands the subtleties of language, and teases meaning out of obscure mysteries. An entertainer with speechcraft skill knows how to move his audience, how to reinforce a tale's moral, and how to make a tale come alive for the listener. A diplomat -- or fast-talking con man -- can sway the judgements and emotions of a listener to achieve his own ends.|BNAM:;bard; knight; agent; bard

The ship drifted into a gale, and by the time I woke, it was too late. I couldn't regain control, and the ship capsized. There were only two survivors -- me, and an old man whose entire family was lost in the wreck. I told the man of my terrible failure, and he used his power as a seer and wizard to punish me.

Corprus disease can't be cured. And some say vampirism is a disease. But the only cure for a vampire is destroying it. Policy on vampires is 'kill on sight.' Or 'run on sight.'
