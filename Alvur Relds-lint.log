  |DATA|ONAM:Synnolian Tunifus|DNAM:Imperial Cult|NAME:Bring me one unit of netch leather for cure paralyzation potions. The Ascadian Isles is a good place to hunt. I suggest you start by looking around near Balur Salvu's house. He says he sees wild bull netch all the time. Now, stick with bull netch to start with. The betty netch are rather more dangerous.|SCVR:04JX3IC6_Rat|INTV:2|SCVR:14JX4IC7_netch|INTV|BNAM:;Synnolian Tunifus;  Journal IC7_netch 1
