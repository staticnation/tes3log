  tribunal.esm---------------->|DATA|NAME:A Nord named Ennbjof gave me a key and a tale about a ship burial of Olmgerd the Outlaw, son of Harald Hand-Free, a First Age king of Skyrim. Ennbjof thinks an enchanted battle-axe called Stormkiss was buried with Oldgerd. Ennbjof thinks the burial is somewhere on the stretch between the Daedric ruins at Zaintiraris and Tel Branora, on the western side of the peninsula.
