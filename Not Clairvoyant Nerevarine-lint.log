  morrowind.esm------------------>|DATA|ONAM:travellingnewwoman|NAME:My parents told me not to lick the Hist tree until my Naming Day, so I did. My parents caught me and a boy from my nest in a soft-leaf patch right before the naming ceremony. I feared I'd get more of a licking from my parents than I gave the tree... So I ran as fast as I could through the swamp and into the rest of the kids waiting for their naming ceremony. Everyone had a good laugh and the name stuck.

I made my way here, and lived with my father for three years until he was killed by the Telvanni. He and Athyn Sarethi were friends, so I was adopted in a sense. I don't miss Hammerfell. I'm working for a just cause. I serve with some of the best warriors in Tamriel. And the Ashlands can have a peculiar beauty...
