  tribunal.esm-------------------->|DATA|NAME:I met Lucan Ostorius, who claims to be a trader. He is waiting for Yak gro-Skandar, a smith with whom he was supposed to trade some goods. Apparently, though, gro-Skandar has yet to show up, agitating Lucan greatly. It seems Lucan would like me to help him by delivering a shipment of weapons for him to Yak gro-Skandar at the Rat in the Pot in Ald'ruhn. He has offered to pay me 100 septims for my time, and he asks me to swear an oath to Zenithar to seal the bargain.

  morrowind.esm------------------->|DATA|ONAM:rasha|NAME:Yes. Most pressing. I have, you see, a shipment of clothing...fine clothing, it is...to get to Ald-ruhn. But, I fear other business draws me away. Perhaps, I think, you and I might come to an arrangement, yes? If you will deliver Rasha's shirts...these fine, fine shirts...to Bivale Teneran the clothier in Ald-ruhn, she will pay you for your services. And a generous woman she is. I would ask that you swear an oath to Zenithar to seal our arrangement, though. Yes. What do you think of my offer, hmmmm?|SCVR:04JX4MV_TraderLate|INTV|BNAM:Journal "MV_TraderLate" 20  Choice "I swear to Zenithar I will deliver your shipment." 1 "I'm sorry. I cannot do that now." 2

  morrowind.esm------------------->|DATA|ONAM:lucan ostorius|NAME:Here's the deal: I've got to get these weapons to Yak gro-Skandar in Ald'ruhn as quickly as possible. He was supposed to meet me here, but hasn't shown up yet. I suppose I must have missed him. If you're willing to deliver these to him at the Rat in the Pot, I'd be grateful, and I figure I could throw 100 septims your way. Of course, I'd ask you to swear an oath to Zenithar...may He grace us with lots of loot, that you'd deliver my goods, or, um, face his heavenly wrath.|BNAM:Journal "MV_ThiefTrader" 10  Choice "I swear by Zenithar that I will deliver your goods." 1 "I will not swear an oath." 2
