  |DATA|ONAM:svenja_outside|NAME:The winds have whispered to me, %PCName. They have told me of your failure to enter Hrothmund's Barrow. In order to become chieftain of Thirsk, you needed to enter the barrow and grasp the axe of Hrothmund to receive his blessing. Now, that will never happen. This is a sad day. I fear Thirsk will never reopen.|SCVR:04JX0BM_Airship_a|INTV: |BNAM:Journal BM_Airship_c 20  Goodbye

  |DATA|ONAM:Carnius Magius|NAME:The amenities here are poor, at best. Certainly nothing like what I'm used to. There's a shrine and an armory, but little else. Raven Rock, however, boasts a bar and a Trader's Outpost. All thanks to me, of course.|SCVR:02sX3ColonyState|INTV: |SCVR:12sX0ColonyService|INTV

  morrowind.esm------->|DATA|RNAM:Dark Elf|ANAM:Balmora|NAME:An outlander is anyone born and raised outside of Morrrowind. Most Dunmer think anyone who isn't a native-born Dunmer is an outlander. Dunmer with Western words and ways are also immediately identified as outlanders -- we're very sensitive to accents, clothes, and manners in Morrowind. Outlanders are foreigners, and Morrowind doesn't like foreigners. It's not bad here in Hlaalu territory, but on the rest of Vvardenfell, folk are very cool to outlanders.
