  |DATA|ONAM:neminda|NAME:My father was a Legionnaire stationed in Ebonheart. When my mother died, I was sent to live with my Uncle, but we didn't get along. I made my way here, and lived with my father for three years until he was killed by the Telvanni. He and Athyn Sarethi were friends, so I was adopted in a sense. I don't miss Hammerfell. I'm working for a just cause. I serve with some of the best warriors in Tamriel. And the Ashlands can have a peculiar beauty...

  |DATA|NAME:Skink asked me to kill the Necromancer Telura Ulver in Shal. To get there, I should go north from Hla Oad, cross a bridge and follow the coast to the west until I reach another bridge to an island. The entrance to Shal is in a muck pool on the north side of this island.
