  |DATA|ONAM:milie hastien|NAME:In Morrowind we speak of four different levels of clothing quality: common, expensive, extravagant, and exquisite. Common clothes are cheap and serviceable. Merchants and lesser nobility wear expensive clothes. Extravagant clothes are worn by wealthy merchants and nobles of upper rank. Only the most wealthy can afford exquisite clothes. Persons of exalted rank may not even speak to you if you are unsuitably dressed, so if you plan to deal with the upper classes, make sure you are well-dressed.|BNAM:;clothier; trader;
