[DUP-INF]: ID=2136174887007007(Topic:cantons)
  |DATA|ONAM:Synnolian Tunifus|NAME:Vivec's cantons are buildings with many levels. The upperworks are the rooftops with shops and rich folks' manors. The waistworks are the next tier down, usually shops and guilds, with some apartments. Canalside is the lowest level, where poor folks live. The underworks are sewers below canalside; only grubbers and cleaners go down there. The corridors are like mazes, so watch how you go. The Temple built all the cantons, and leases them to shops, guilds, and residents.|BNAM:;vivec

[DUP-INF]: ID=218051894382021198(Topic:imperial cult)
  |DATA|ONAM:caius cosades|NAME:The Imperial cult worships the Nine Divines: the Aedra Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, and Julianos, and Tiber Septim, founder and patron of the Empire. In Morrowind, it's partly maintaining the faith for outlanders like us, and partly a missionary cult, bringing enlightment to the heathen Dunmer. You can see Somutis Vunnis at Fort Moonmoth to join, but you have to go to Ebonheart if you want to become a lay servant.|SCVR:04JX3A1_1_FindSpymaster|INTV

[DUP-INF]: ID=440036312672719594(Topic:morrowind lore)
  |DATA|ONAM:Vedam Dren|NAME:We have grown too complacent about the threat of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain. For ages we've relied on the Tribunal to contain the menace. But Dagoth Ur's power is waxing as the Tribunal's power is waning. The Legion garrisons here are insufficient to protect our settlements, and there's no hope for reinforcements. Our people have always relied on a charismatic leader to rally squabbling factions against a common foe. You are that leader. Now we must rely on you.|SCVR:04JX3B8_All_Hortator|INTV:2

[DUP-INF]: ID=580687901619326537(Topic:dunmer)
  |DATA|ONAM:Iulus Truptor|NAME:The Buckmoth fund, based in Fort Buckmoth, serves the citizens of nearby Ald'ruhn. But most Ald'ruhn residents are Dunmer belonging to House Redoran, and therefore members of the Tribunal Temple, so it may be hard to collect alms for the poor in Ald'ruhn on behalf of the Imperial cult.|SCVR:04JX3IC9_Argonian_alms|INTV

[DUP-INF]: ID=749914731240121175(Topic:specific place)
  |DATA|ONAM:elone|NAME:Pelagiad is the next town up the road. Cross the bridge out of town and just stay on the road. From Pelagiad, take the road north to Balmora and Caldera, or east to Ebonheart and Vivec. If you have the cash, and are in a hurry, or afraid of getting lost, take the silt strider to Balmora or Vivec. Speak to Darvame Hleran at the silt strider landing, across the bridge and south along the shore. And if you plan to travel widely, get a copy of 'Guide to Vvardenfell' from Arrille. It's got maps.

  |DATA|RNAM:Dark Elf|ANAM:Balmora, Council Club|NAME:This is a nice Dunmer establishment. For native Dunmer. We aren't interested in the Imperial cult, outlander. We aren't interested in anything Imperial here. Understand?|SCVR:0CsX0nolore|INTV:

  |DATA|ONAM:artisa arelas|NAME:The Ashlands are the dry, inhospitable wastelands surrounding the lower slopes of Red Mountain. The Ashlands extend to the Sea of Ghosts to the north, and elsewhere form a wide margin between the blighted Red Mountain region and other geographic regions. The town of Ald'ruhn and the village of Maar Gan are the only sizable permanent Ashlands settlements. Ashlanders hunt for game here, and their herds find sparse grazing. It rains rarely, and suffers frequent ash storms.|BNAM:;scout; savant;

  tribunal.esm------------------->|DATA|CNAM:Miner|ANAM:Dissapla Mine|NAME:Smuggling raw glass is a crime. All raw glass belongs to the Emperor, so it's the crime of treason, and punished by death. But... there's so much money to be made selling black market raw glass that it's a rare merchant who'll refuse to buy a piece from you. Of course, if the mine guards catch you stealing raw glass, they just kill you. Which is why we don't steal raw glass.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:

  |DATA|FNAM:Ashlanders|NAME:No one will ever grow rich hunting. But it is a pure pleasure for itself. Take your time. Sneak up on your prey. Surprise it with a swift, silent arrow. There is no greater pleasure than to drop a cliff racer with a single arrow.|SCVR:02sX4Random100|INTV

[DUP-INF]: ID=2520193102282412339(Topic:argonian)
  |DATA|FNAM:Ashlanders|NAME:Argonians are the savage half-men of the southern marshes. Our peoples used to keep them as slaves, but they are useless. The settled people still keep them as slaves to grub in the soil. They are dirty and wicked, and we should drive them all back into the swamps they came from.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:; Ashlanders

[DUP-INF]: ID=2768358951609618900(Topic:dunmer)
  |DATA|ONAM:Vedam Dren|NAME:It will be difficult to overcome the Dunmer's lingering resentment of Imperial occupation. Ironically, it is now, in the face of the menace of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain, that we have a great opportunity to unite natives and colonists against a common threat. When the Dunmer fight side by side with outlanders like you against the hosts of Dagoth Ur, our common peril and purpose must unite us.

[DUP-INF]: ID=5024239721273824353(Topic:foreign quarter)
  |DATA|ANAM:Vivec|NAME:The Foreign Quarter is the large three-tiered canton to the north. Originally, foreigners were not allowed to enter Vivec any further than the Foreign Quarter, but now outlanders can travel throughout Vivec at will. The Imperial Guilds each have guildhalls and complete services here, and an Imperial cult shrine serves the spiritual needs of the Imperial faithful. Various independent tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers also rent space here. The Black Shalk Cornerclub rents beds to non-guild visitors.|SCVR:0BLX0Vivec, Foreign Quarter|INTV|SCVR:1CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Vivec;

[DUP-INF]: ID=7890181971676018509(Topic:st. olms canton)
  |DATA|ANAM:Vivec|NAME:St. Delyn Canton and St. Olms Canton are residence cantons for commoners and paupers. The Temple charges very reasonable rents for comfortable workshops, shops, and apartments, and most of Vvardenfell's crafts and light industry is housed in these cantons. The Abbey of St. Delyn the Wise is on the top tier of St. Delyn, and Hlaalu Councilor Yngling Half-Troll has a top-tier manor on St. Olms.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Vivec;

  |DATA|ONAM:elone|NAME:Vivec City is south on the road from Pelagiad. Vivec is the largest settlement on Vvardenfell, and one of the largest cities in the East. Built on Norvayn Bay, completely surrounded by water, the city itself is a group of giant town-sized buildings called 'cantons'. The High Fane and the palace of Vivec are visited by hundreds of tourists and pilgrims daily. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the Foreign Canton, while natives live, work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential cantons.|BNAM:ShowMap Vivec

  |DATA|ONAM:sul-matuul|NAME:The khans of the Great Houses are called 'councilors.' The khans of House Telvanni meet in a very strange place, I'm told. They call it 'Sadrith Mora,' which means 'forest of the mushrooms' in our tongue. I have heard the Telvanni live in giant mushrooms. I'm sure it is a very bad place. But you must go and find their councilors and persuade them to name you Hortator.|SCVR:04JX3A2_6_Incarnate|INTV:2|BNAM:;Sul-Matuul; Journal "A2-6_Incarnate" >= 50

  |DATA|ONAM:caius cosades|NAME:House Telvanni is one of the three Dunmer Great Houses on Vvardenfell. Their nobles are thousand-year-old wizards. Telvanni are supposed to hate politics, foreigners, and just about everything else, but the Vvardenfell Telvanni are apparently more ambitious and adventurous than most. I don't know much about them, but they do hire Western mercenaries, and some even rise to higher ranks. Talk to Telvanni councilors if you want to be become a Telvanni retainer.|SCVR:04JX3A1_1_FindSpymaster|INTV
