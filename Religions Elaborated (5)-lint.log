  morrowind.esm---------------->|DATA|FNAM:Imperial Cult|NAME:We accept all citizens of good character and earnest faith. We ask only a one-time pledge of 50 drakes to aid us in our good works. Thereafter, the only cost of membership comes when you use a healing altar -- modest and nominal fees which help us in our mission to bring the words and blessings of the Nine to those less fortunate than ourselves.

  morrowind.esm---------------->|DATA|FNAM:Imperial Cult|DNAM:Imperial Cult|NAME:It is not possible to become a priest or consecrated cleric without joining cult orders. You would be forced to devote yourself full time to the Imperial Cult, which doesn't suit adventurous people like yourself. But we do need lay servants -- earnest laymen dedicated to serving the Nine -- for certain unglamorous but spiritually rewarding tasks. At present we need almoners to serve Zenithar, lay healers to serve Mara, and shrine sergeants to serve Stendarr.
