  morrowind.esm-------------------------->|DATA|NAME:I told Iulus Truptor I was not be able to obtain a red shirt with a black vest for the Harvest's End pageant. He was disappointed, and told me to decide whether my talents and temperaments are suited for soliciting donations. Before I approach him again for an almoner's mission, I must be sure I want to give the Imperial cult my full commitment.
  Quest Tweaks and Alternatives_1.17.esp->|DATA|NAME:Iulus Truptor lost it when I told him I couldn't find the shirt and vest for him. He could have had one custom made, but instead he chewed me out for not performing a miracle to save him from his poor lack of planning. I got fed up and resigned as an almoner. If he wants those clothes so badly, he can sew them himself. What's funny is he'd obsessed with having the right clothes for this First Harvest pageant, and right away, but it's not even the right time of year.
