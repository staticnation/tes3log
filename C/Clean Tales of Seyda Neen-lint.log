  |DATA|ONAM:Vedam Dren|NAME:We have grown too complacent about the threat of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain. For ages we've relied on the Tribunal to contain the menace. But Dagoth Ur's power is waxing as the Tribunal's power is waning. The Legion garrisons here are insufficient to protect our settlements, and there's no hope for reinforcements. Our people have always relied on a charismatic leader to rally squabbling factions against a common foe. You are that leader. Now we must rely on you.|SCVR:04JX3B8_All_Hortator|INTV:2

  |DATA|ONAM:adusamsi assurnarairan|NAME:You can find Imperial cult services in Fort Buckmoth, Fort Moonmoth, Fort Pelagiad, Fort Darius, Wolverine Hall in Sadrith Mora, Vivec Foreign Quarter, and Imperial chapels in Ebonheart. Seek training at Wolverine Hall, Fort Buckmoth, Fort Moonmoth, Ebonheart Imperial Chapels, Governor's Hall in Caldera, and Ald Velothi Outpost. Many Imperial cult locations have healing altars.

  |DATA|ONAM:elone|NAME:Pelagiad is the next town up the road. Cross the bridge out of town and just stay on the road. From Pelagiad, take the road north to Balmora and Caldera, or east to Ebonheart and Vivec. If you have the cash, and are in a hurry, or afraid of getting lost, take the silt strider to Balmora or Vivec. Speak to Darvame Hleran at the silt strider landing, across the bridge and south along the shore. And if you plan to travel widely, get a copy of 'Guide to Vvardenfell' from Arrille. It's got maps.

  |DATA|CNAM:Miner|ANAM:Dissapla Mine|NAME:Smuggling raw glass is a crime. All raw glass belongs to the Emperor, so it's the crime of treason, and punished by death. But... there's so much money to be made selling black market raw glass that it's a rare merchant who'll refuse to buy a piece from you. Of course, if the mine guards catch you stealing raw glass, they just kill you. Which is why we don't steal raw glass.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:

  |DATA|FNAM:Ashlanders|NAME:Argonians are the savage half-men of the southern marshes. Our peoples used to keep them as slaves, but they are useless. The settled people still keep them as slaves to grub in the soil. They are dirty and wicked, and we should drive them all back into the swamps they came from.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:; Ashlanders

[DUP-INF]: ID=2768358951609618900(Topic:dunmer)
  |DATA|ONAM:Vedam Dren|NAME:It will be difficult to overcome the Dunmer's lingering resentment of Imperial occupation. Ironically, it is now, in the face of the menace of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain, that we have a great opportunity to unite natives and colonists against a common threat. When the Dunmer fight side by side with outlanders like you against the hosts of Dagoth Ur, our common peril and purpose must unite us.

  |DATA|ONAM:neminda|NAME:Of course, as an outlander like myself you must know very little about mudcrabs. They are small creatures with a hard shell. They live mostly along the coast and they're usually not aggressive... but if they ever get the taste of meat, they become hunters. Some naturalists believe they are related to the Emperor Crab.
