  morrowind.esm------------->|DATA|ANAM:Vivec|NAME:Well, it's probably no better than Crassius' old plays, which were awful. "Dance of the Three-Legged Guar" was quite a sight, though.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:
  Curio's Argonian Maid.ESP->|DATA|ANAM:Vivec|NAME:Councilor Curio is known for his risque' plays. The Dunmer balk at them, but they don't have much a sense of humor. "Dance of the Three-Legged Guar" and "The Taming of the Khajiiti" were quite popular among us outlanders. I am looking forward to his latest work.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:
