  |DATA|ONAM:elone|NAME:Pelagiad is the next town up the road. Cross the bridge out of town and just stay on the road. From Pelagiad, take the road north to Balmora and Caldera, or east to Ebonheart and Vivec. If you have the cash, and are in a hurry, or afraid of getting lost, take the silt strider to Balmora or Vivec. Speak to Darvame Hleran at the silt strider landing, across the bridge and south along the shore. And if you plan to travel widely, get a copy of 'Guide to Vvardenfell' from Arrille. It's got maps.
