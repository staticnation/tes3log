You might want to fight against some of Vvardenfell's lesser evils before you take on this challenge, but you have done well in the Temple so far. When you feel you are ready, the elder vampire Raxle Berne hides from the light in the Dwemer ruin of Galom Daeus. I will mark Uvirith's Grave on your map. From there go south until you reach a river of lava. Follow that river to the west until it ends. Galom Daeus lies ahead of you.|BNAM:Journal TT_GalomDeus 10  Player->AddItem "Warden's Ring" 1  Player->AddItem "daedric warhammer_ttgd" 1  Player->AddItem "belt of balyna's soothing balm" 1  ShowMap "Uvirith's Grave"
