  morrowind.esm------------>|DATA|ONAM:eydis fire-eye|NAME:Duke Vedam Dren himself gave us a contract to take care of the problem. Go to Alof's Farm northeast of Pelagiad.... What do you mean Alof is dead? What were you thinking, %PCRank? Well, the contract still needs to be filled. Apparently, our only source of information is dead, so you'll just have to search the area until you figure out which orcs to get rid of. Check for any ruins nearby; it'd be a good place for them to hide out.|SCVR:06DX2alof the easterner|INTV:|BNAM:Journal FG_AlofsFarm 15

  morrowind.esm------------>|DATA|ONAM:Vedam Dren|NAME:I have no reason to hate Orcs. In fact, I admire King Gortwog for his political skill. In the case of the Orcs at Alof's farm, however, I've heard that the leader is the Barbarian Burub gra-Bamog. She is wanted for murder, theft, and banditry. If Burub is gathering forces in Ashunartes, I want someone to put a stop to it.

  |DATA|NAME:Alof the Easterner said the Orcs come from Ashunartes which is northeast of here and just west of an old Dunmer stronghold. Alof thinks the rest of the Orcs will leave if I kill their leader, a Barbarian by the name of Burub gra-Bamog.

That's better than nothing, anyway. I'll tell you what I know about those Orcs.|SCVR:04JX2FG_AlofsFarm|INTV:|BNAM:Choice "Continue" 1
