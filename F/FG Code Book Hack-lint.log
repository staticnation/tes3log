  morrowind.esm--------->|DATA|ONAM:sottilde|DNAM:Thieves Guild|NAME:Look, %PCRank, I'll tell you what's going on. This code book has dirt on the Camonna Tong and the skooma trade. As soon as we get it figured out, we take it to the authorities and take over the trade ourselves. The Fighters Guild works for the Camonna Tong since Sjoring Hard-Heart took over. You have to decide where your loyalties lie, %PCRank.|SCVR:34JX3FG_Sottilde|INTV:
