[MOD-INF]: ID=2769862822480624623(Topic:uriel septim)
  morrowind.esm-->|DATA|ONAM:chargen captain|NAME:Yes, Uriel Septim is still the emperor. According to my instructions, he personally authorized your release from prison and your delivery here. It's all very mysterious. But that's the way the Empire works. Silence. Secrecy. Let not the left hand know what the right hand is doing.
  FreshStart.esp->|DATA|ONAM:chargen captain|NAME:I serve the emperor and I'll not hear one word against him.

[MOD-INF]: ID=3253423749290424070(Topic:morrowind)
  morrowind.esm-->|DATA|ONAM:chargen captain|NAME:Yes. You're in Morrowind. I don't know why you're here. Or why you were released from prison and shipped here. But your authorization comes directly from Emperor Uriel Septim VII himself. And I don't need to know any more than that. When you leave this office, you are a free man. But before you go, I have instructions on your duties. Instructions from the Emperor. So pay careful attention.
  FreshStart.esp->|DATA|ONAM:chargen captain|NAME:Vvardenfell may be just a small island of Morrowind, but Red Mountain looms large over us all.

  tribunal.esm--->|DATA|NAME:My orders are to go to the town of Balmora in Vvardenfell District and report to a man named Caius Cosades. To find out where he lives, I should ask in Balmora at the cornerclub called South Wall. When I find Caius Cosades, I must give him a package of documents, and wait for further orders.
  FreshStart.esp->|DATA|NAME:On a suspicious corpse outside Balmora, I found orders to report to a man named Caius Cosades. To find out where he lives, I could ask in Balmora at the cornerclub called South Wall. If I find Caius Cosades, I might give him the package of coded documents I found and see what happens.
