  |DATA|NAME:Tuls Valen wants me to reenact Vivec's compassionate healing of a foe. I must either learn the Rilm's Gift spell or use the potion he gave me to cure the Orc Bulfim gra-Shugharz of Ash-Chancre. Bulfim gra-Shugarz is in Maelkashishi. I can get there by heading east from Ald Velothi until I reach the mountains, then following the mountains south.
