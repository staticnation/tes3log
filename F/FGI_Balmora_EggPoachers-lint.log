  morrowind.esm--------------->|DATA|NAME:We haven't seen Sevilo Othan or Daynila Valas. But eggs keep disappearing. And they know the place. Easy for them to get in and out, stay out of sight.|SCVR:04JX3FG_Egg_Poachers|INTV
  FGI_Balmora_EggPoachers.esp->|DATA|NAME:We haven't seen Sevilo Othan or Daynila Valas. But eggs keep disappearing. And they know the place. Easy for them to get in and out, stay out of sight. Actually, the Fighters Guild is the last one I expected to do this job. Yes, the poachers are clearly not good people. But killing them definitely goes beyond the law. And as long as I remember, the Fighters Guild was a law-abiding organization. At least, back when Percius Mercius was in charge.|SCVR:04JX3FG_Egg_Poachers|INTV|BNAM:set FGI_EggPoachersFlag to 1

  FGI_Balmora_EggPoachers.esp->|DATA|ONAM:dinok|NAME:It looks like Dram Bero has finally decided to teach Sevilo Othan and Daynila Valas a lesson. Can't support his methods, though. They don't deserve to die just for poaching eggs. And what does the Fighters Guild do? They agree to do his will, despite what the Imperial law says. Percius Mercius wouldn't let this happen when he was the Guildmaster. Ask him about that when you get the chance.|SCVR:04JX3FG_Egg_Poachers|INTV|BNAM:set FGI_EggPoachersFlag to 1
