  |DATA|ONAM:sorkvild the raven|NAME:No matter what the locals say, the practice is not outlawed by the Empire, you should know that. They have nothing to fear of me.

  |DATA|ONAM:Carnius Magius|NAME:The amenities here are poor, at best. Certainly nothing like what I'm used to. There's a shrine and an armory, but little else.

[DUP-INF]: ID=25659223951448129046(Topic:services)
  |DATA|ONAM:Sathyn Andrano|NAME:Aside from this shop, you mean? Well, that's an easy answer. Nothing. If it's not for sale here, you'll have to try checking at Fort Frostmoth. And, given my stock, it's probably not for sale here.
