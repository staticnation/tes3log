  bloodmoon.esm----------------->|DATA|NAME:I met an odd old man living in a small workshop, out in the wilderness of Solstheim. Inspired by a child's silly song, he took on the role of Uncle Sweetshare, the legendary giver of candy and spreader of cheer. He even wears a white helmet. What's most disturbing is that this particular Uncle Sweetshare has been spreading his unique brand of happiness by secretly giving people moon sugar. It's obvious this madman is the culprit Severia Gratius hired me to kill.
