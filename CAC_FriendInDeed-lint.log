  |DATA|ONAM:alusaron|NAME:Sure, I'd like that contract! Hmm...how would you like to help me out, friend? If you could steal that contract from Ralen Tilvur, he wouldn't be able to fill the order properly. Then, when his customer shows up to collect, I'll be ready with the proper order!|SCVR:04JX0EB_Deed|INTV|BNAM:Journal "EB_Deed" 20  Choice "I'll get that contract for you." 1 "I can't help you." 2
