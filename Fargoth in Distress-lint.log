  Fargoth in Distress.ESP->|DATA|NAME:As Hrisskar's superior in the Imperial Legion, I commanded him to leave Fargoth alone. However, he was unwilling to obey me, as I'm an Elf. He could not tolerate someone like me commanding him around, so he attacked me. Well, that takes care of the harassment problem of Fargoth, at least.|QSTF

  |DATA|ONAM:hrisskar flat-foot|NAME:Excellent. Here's what I want you to do. I'm not sure where he goes, but I know he wanders around town at night. Watch his movements. The best vantage point is on top of the lighthouse south of town. That will give you a nice view of all of Seyda Neen. If you keep an eye on where he goes, I'm sure you'll be able to figure out where he's hiding that gold.|SCVR:01500|INTV|BNAM:Journal "MS_Lookout" 20

  morrowind.esm----------->|DATA|NAME:I've agreed to help Hrisskar find the money that Fargoth has been hiding away. I am supposed to keep an eye on him from atop the lighthouse in town, and watch where he goes. Hrisskar believes I should watch him at night. I'm not supposed to approach him at any time. I should then retrace his footsteps and find out where he's hidden the money. When I've found it, I should report back to Hrisskar.

  |DATA|ONAM:hrisskar flat-foot|NAME:I know the little fetcher's got one somewhere in town. Just not sure where yet. I've already gone through his whole house, so I know he's not hiding it there. I'd like you find out where he's stashing his gold. If you can, I'll give you a share of the wealth.
