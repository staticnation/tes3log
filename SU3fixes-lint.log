  morrowind.esm->|DATA|CNAM:Enforcer|NAME:Rule Number One: The boss says you do business with him, or you don't do business. You don't know who the boss is? Then you don't do business. Simple. Rule Number Two: You do business, but it is not with the boss, because you have broken Rule Number One. So Rule Number Two is that now I visit you, and after this visit, you never do anything ever again. Except feed the worms. And Rule Number Three is don't push your luck with me. Or I kill you. Nothing personal. Just part of my job.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV

  morrowind.esm->|DATA|ANAM:Suran|NAME:I've heard about that runaway slave Daric Bielle has been looking for. Not too much I can tell you, though.
