  morrowind.esm-------------->|DATA|NAME:I am an enchanter. I enchant things, and sell them. I have scrolls, which are cheap, but only work once, and enchanted items, which work over and over again, but which are NOT cheap. I also make my enchanter's lab available to those who want to enchant items, but who can't afford the expense of building and maintaining a lab. I charge for the service, of course, but you must provide the items, soul gems, and magic effects. I also buy and sell enchanted weapons, enchanted armor, and enchanted clothing.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Enchanter; Enchanted Weapons and Armor; enchanted clothing;
