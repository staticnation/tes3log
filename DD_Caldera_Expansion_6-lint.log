  morrowind.esm-------------->|DATA|ONAM:eydis fire-eye|NAME:Four Telvanni agents are responsible for thefts and disappearances at the Caldera ebony mines. Their names are Alynu Aralen, Sathasa Nerothren, Fothyna Herothran, and Alveleg. They're hiding in a cave in the hills north of Caldera Mine. When the four agents are dead, report back to me. Take care, it's very likely that one of them is on lookout posted outside the mines. The quickest way to Caldera is probably to have the guild guide at the Mages Guild transport you, but it is your choice.|SCVR:34JX3FG_Egg_Poachers|INTV:d|BNAM:Journal FG_Telvanni_agents 1
