  |DATA|CNAM:Warrior|NAME:I'm a warrior by trade. I know how to fight, when necessary, but I much rather look so tough that critters give up or run away when they see me. Personally, I favor long blades of all kinds -- they use long blades of many different styles and craftsmanships here in Morrowind -- and I wear medium armor, for a decent balance of protection and mobility. But I train with various weapon types and armor types. And like any good warrior, I'm my own armorer -- don't want to fight with worn weapons in worn armor.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Warrior; Longblade, Medium Armor, Armorer

  |DATA|CNAM:Merchant|NAME:I am a merchant. I look for goods that are well-made, that people want to buy, that I can buy and sell at a profit. There are many different kinds of materials I can buy and sell -- animal products, vegetable products, mineral products, even exotic products. Crafts and manufactured goods I deal in include weapons, armor, clothing, books, potions, enchanted items, and various housewares. I travel, talk with people I meet, buy what I like, and sell what people like.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Merchant; generic merchants do not have services, and do not buy and sell; they are just merchant quest and scenery characters
