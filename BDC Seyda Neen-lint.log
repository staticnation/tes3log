  |DATA|ONAM:caius cosades|NAME:Vivec City, named for Vivec, a living god of Morrowind, is the largest settlement on Vvardenfell, and one of the largest cities in the East. Take the silt strider from Balmora to Vivec; it's fast, cheap, and safe. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, walk the road south from Balmora, past Pelagiad, through the Ascadian Isles to Vivec. Be careful. It's easy to lose the road or blunder into beasts when traveling by night or in bad weather. Travel by day to avoid getting lost.
