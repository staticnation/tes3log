  |DATA|ONAM:hrisskar flat-foot|NAME:I know the little fetcher's got one somewhere in town. Just not sure where yet. I've already gone through his whole house, so I know he's not hiding it there. I'd like you find out where he's stashing his gold. If you can, I'll give you a share of the wealth. Are you up for it?|SCVR:04JX0MS_Lookout|INTV:|BNAM:Journal "MS_Lookout" 10  Choice "I'll do it." 1 "No thanks." 2
