I teach the citizens the basics of block, spear, and long blade, but mostly I concentrate on athletics and acrobatics, because conditioning is the biggest weakness of the citizen-soldier. No point teaching them to fight if they pass out after a short jog in full kit.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Drillmaster; Improving Athletics, Acrobatics, blocking
