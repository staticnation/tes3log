  morrowind.esm------------------>|DATA|ONAM:dagoth uthol|NAME:Lord Dagoth says you will join us or die. I thought you might just leave us alone, and go about your own affairs. But Lord Dagoth says it is not your way, to leave a thing well enough alone. Perhaps. I cannot remember you at all. But I do my Lord's bidding. I have always done his bidding. So go to him and submit. You will be given power and place. And, perhaps, peace and forgiveness. Do as you like.|BNAM:; Dagoth Uthol; Kogoruhn;   SetFight 50  Goodbye
