  |DATA|ONAM:sharn gra-muzgob|NAME:The Temple refers to any demented impostor who claims to be the Nerevarine as "the False Incarnate". The Temple treats such persons as insane, and Ordinators pursue and imprison them "for their own protection." The Temple has reported that the most recent False Incarnate, a girl child named Peakstar, has died, but they've produced no body, and skeptics are suspicious of Temple claims.|SCVR:34JX3A1_4_MuzgobInformant|INTV

The city of Almalexia is located in Indoril District, and the Indoril are orthodox and conservative supporters of the Temple and Temple authority.

  |DATA|ONAM:mehra milo|NAME:The Dissident priests dispute Temple doctrine, and are outlawed and persecuted by the Temple. Ordinators arrest and imprison heretics, and the Empire cannot interfere. 'Progress of Truth' lists their beliefs. In brief, they challenge the purity and divinity of the Tribunal, suggesting their powers are sorcerous, not divine, and perhaps akin to the powers of Dagoth Ur. They also condemn the arbitrary power of the Ordinators, and accuse the Temple hierarchy of self-interest and corruption.|SCVR:04JX3A1_10_MehraMilo|INTV|SCVR:14JX4A2_4_MiloGone|INTV|BNAM:;Mehra Milo
