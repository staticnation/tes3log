[DUP-INF]: ID=1958550751691917436(Topic:dwemer)
  |DATA|ONAM:hasphat antabolis|NAME:The Dwemer are the fabled lost Dwarven race whose ruins and splendid artifacts are scattered across Tamriel. Elves use the term "Dwemer," connoting variously "deep-delving," "profound," and "close-counseled"; Imperial usage is "Dwarven," derived in fable from the affectionate regard of the Giant races for their "little" Dwemer friends. There are several Dwemer sites on Vvardenfell, and many have found Dwemer artifacts.|SCVR:34JX3A1_2_AntabolisInformant|INTV:
