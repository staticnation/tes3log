Olumba says Cunius Pelelius has gotten into money trouble, and that he's trying to handle his trouble by skimming from the Caldera mine and smuggling raw ebony. I might be able to pressure Cunius Pelelius if I had proof of his misdeeds. Olumba says the slaves in the mine would know, but they'll be afraid to talk. Perhaps I can persuade them....

He has offered to pay me 100 septims for my time, and he asks me to swear an oath to Zenithar to seal the bargain.
