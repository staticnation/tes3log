  morrowind.esm------->|DATA|ANAM:Sadrith Mora|NAME:The Gateway merchant inn is all that's open to non-Telvanni. Telvanni kin and retainers stay at Wolverine Hall, housing the Fighters Guild and Thieves Guild and the Imperial cult shrine. The Council Hall is the big sphere down by the harbor. The Great Market has many services and tradesmen, and many others are scattered through town. There are two cornerclubs: Durty Muriel's, for outlanders, and Fara's Hole in the Wall for local Dunmer. Tel Naga is Master Neloth's wizard tower.|SCVR:07XX0gals arethi|INTV|INTV|INTV|SCVR:3CsX0nolore|INTV:|BNAM:;Sadrith Mora;   Choice "Continue" 1

  morrowind.esm------->|DATA|ANAM:Sadrith Mora, Wolverine Hall|NAME:Yes. She teaches Conjuration and Mysticism and Destruction at the Mage Guild. You think she might be involved in the Gateway haunting? Well. I suppose it's possible. Uleni Heleran has a mischievous personality, and she has some sort of bad feeling for Angaredhel and the Gateway Inn. I also noticed that Uleni Heleran has been magically transporting into Wolverine Hall quite a bit lately. Maybe she's using a Mark and Recall spell sequence or a Divine Intervention.|SCVR:07XX0uleni heleran|INTV|SCVR:14JX3town_Sadrith|INTV: |SCVR:24JX4town_Sadrith|INTV:2|SCVR:3CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Sadrith Mora, Wolverine Hall; Journal "town_Sadrith" >= 10; Journal "town_Sadrith" < 50; NOT Uleni Heleran;  Journal "town_Sadrith" 20
