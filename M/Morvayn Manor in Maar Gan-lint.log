  morrowind.esm----------------->|DATA|ONAM:brara morvayn|NAME:I am a widow. My husband died defending Morvayn Manor from misshapen beasts that came through the Ghostfence. He believed that the beasts were attracted by a statue we recieved a few weeks before the attacks began. Go to Morvyan Manor, just east of Skar, here's the key. Get the statue, and take it to Lloros Sarano at the Temple. Once the statue has been destroyed, I will support you on the Council.|BNAM:Journal HR_MorvaynManor 10  Player->AddItem "key_morvaynmanor" 1
