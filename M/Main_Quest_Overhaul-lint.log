  Main_Quest_Overhaul.ESP->|DATA|ONAM:sul-matuul|NAME:I want to speak plainly. I find it hard to believe that you are the Nerevarine. You are an outlander, but the Nerevarine comes to drive all outlanders from Morrowind. How could an outlander be the Incarnate? The Great Houses stole our lands and mocked us with false gods. The godless outlanders steal our land and our dignity. The Nerevarine is the last hope the Ashlanders have.

It seems she is willing to help me unravel the Nerevarine prophecies and my part in them. She tells me to seek the lost prophecies among the Dissident priests of the Temple. If I bring these lost prophecies to her, she will be my guide. And she gave me copies of the Nerevarine prophecies called 'The Stranger' and 'The Seven Visions'. Now it's time to report back to Caius.|QSTF
