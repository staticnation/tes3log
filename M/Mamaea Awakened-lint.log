  Mamaea Awakened.ESP->|DATA|ONAM:dagoth araynys|NAME:So. You are the one my brother Voryn calls Nerevar. No, say nothing. I do not care if you truly are the Hortator. His time is gone. But you... You've done well to come this far. Did you like my little tests? They weren't for you, you know. My children are devoted, but sometimes they lack understanding of the sublime. They think in the straight lines of the mundane, when they need to be guided by the chords of the Song.|SCVR:01630|INTV:|BNAM:;Dagoth Araynys [thief-mage]  Choice "I've seen worse." 1 "You're all mad. Don't you have better things to do than stack chairs?" 2 "It was interesting, I'll give you that." 3 "I AM Indoril Nerevar reborn." 4
