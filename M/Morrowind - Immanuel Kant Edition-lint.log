  |DATA|ONAM:Iulus Truptor|NAME:Thank you, %PCName. You have exceeded our greatest expectations. I'm afraid we have no more tasks to challenge your remarkable abilities. I suspect you already outstrip your teachers. Perhaps you will consider becoming one of our lay healers or shrine sergeants, if you have not already sampled these duties. I have also passed your name to our Oracle here, Lalatia Varian. She may have tasks suited to your talents. But before you go, I have one last gift for you to remember us by.
