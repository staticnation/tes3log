  |DATA|ONAM:garothmuk gro-muzgub|NAME:Every culture produces some variant on the short multi-purpose weapon called the dagger. Dagger weapons differ dramatically in quality and effectiveness; they are further differentiated by a wide variety of enchantments commonly placed on these easily concealed weapons. Daedric and glass daggers are shockingly efficient weapons, despite their small size and low mass.
