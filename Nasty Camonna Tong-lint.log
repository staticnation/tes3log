  morrowind.esm---------->|DATA|ONAM:caius cosades|NAME:The Camonna Tong is Morrowind's native criminal syndicate. They're tough and ruthless, and have connections in the higher ranks of House Hlaalu. The Camonna Tong compete directly with the Thieves Guild for control of illegal trade, and Camonna Tong will not tolerate competition. Compared with the Camonna Tong, the Thieves Guild is relatively decent and honorable -- certainly less brutal. They don't accept outlanders as members. Forget about it.|SCVR:04JX3A1_1_FindSpymaster|INTV
  Nasty Camonna Tong.esp->|DATA|FNAM:Camonna Tong|ANAM:Balmora|NAME:We're just natives, trying to get along. It isn't easy, with all the ignorant foreigners sticking their noses where they don't belong. Can I make it any clearer, outlander?
