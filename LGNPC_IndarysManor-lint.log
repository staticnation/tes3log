[DUP-INF]: ID=2797922446197547893(Topic:ashlanders and foreigners)
  |DATA|ONAM:hassour zainsubani|NAME:Most Ashlanders wish all foreigners and their false gods could be driven from Morrowind. At very least, Ashlanders wish the foreign devils would leave them in peace. Ashlanders think it shameful to attack unarmed persons, but they will kill without hesitation an armed person who offends them or their clan laws. No Ashlander is fool enough to make war against the Empire. However, if such a war might be won, many Ashlanders might cheerfully give their lives to win such a war.|SCVR:34JX3A1_11_ZainsubaniInformant|INTV
