  bloodmoon.esm--------------------------->|DATA|ONAM:ulfgar the unending|NAME:I came to Solstheim with four of my brothers-in-arms.  We were on a quest, you see.  We were getting close...we could feel it.  But then, one of our fellowship -- a powerful sorceror named Grimkell -- betrayed the rest of us.  He laid an ambush, and assailed us with powerful magicka.  I managed to slay Grimkell, but not before my three other companions were turned to stone. You may have seen them, for they are the three standing stones of Brodir Grove, not far from here.|SCVR:04JX3BM_BrodirGrove|INTV:|BNAM:Journal BM_BrodirGrove 10

  |DATA|CNAM:Merchant|NAME:I am a merchant. I look for goods that are well-made, that people want to buy, that I can buy and sell at a profit. There are many different kinds of materials I can buy and sell -- animal products, vegetable products, mineral products, even exotic products. Crafts and manufactured goods I deal in include weapons, armor, clothing, books, potions, enchanted items, and various housewares. I travel, talk with people I meet, buy what I like, and sell what people like.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Merchant; generic merchants do not have services, and do not buy and sell; they are just merchant quest and scenery characters
