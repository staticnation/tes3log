  morrowind.esm-------->|DATA|ONAM:Synnolian Tunifus|NAME:Gurak gro-Bagrat, netch rancher, horticulturist, and smuggler, lives just north of the bridge from the Vivec Foreign Quarter to the mainland. Everyone knows he smuggles skooma, but he's got friends in the Legion, and Camonna Tong protection, so no one will touch him. Perhaps it is wrong, but I steal willow anther from the willow flowers he grows outside his manor. Be careful. Gurak gro-Bagrat is a dangerous criminal. Under NO circumstances enter his home. Do NOT try to speak to him.
