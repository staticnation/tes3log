  tribunal.esm---------------->|DATA|ONAM:crassius curio|NAME:Well. If you are the Nerevarine, why haven't you fulfilled the prophecies? Surely you haven't forgotten. You haven't done something foolish, have you? You mustn't be shy, dumpling. I've heard that Archcanon Tholer Saryoni, the high priest of the Temple, is VERY upset, and that he is hoping that you will come speak with him at the High Fane here in Vivec City. Maybe that would be a good idea.
