The farmhouse is north of the road, south of the southwestern end of Lake Hairan. Just head north from Ebonheart. Don't take the bridge west towards Seyda Neen. When you hit the east-west road between Pelagiad and Vivec, turn right, east, towards Vivec, and Balur's farm is not far. If you reach a bridge, you've gone too far. Balur's a shrewd fellow.

I'm to ask Theldyn Virith if there's anything else he needs done while I'm there.
