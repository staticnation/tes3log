[DUP-INF]: ID=203602544310701588(Topic:murder nerevar)
  |DATA|NAME:We did not murder Nerevar. The legend that we murdered Nerevar comes from a story told by a shield-companion to Nerevar, Alandro Sul, who lived among the Ashlanders. The Ashlanders have retained Alandro Sul's account as part of their oral histories. The account is persuasive in some details, implausible in others, and is in any case false. I have two accounts of Nerevar's death here in my library. Read them, and judge for yourself.|SCVR:04JX3B8_MeetVivec|INTV:2|BNAM:;Vivec; Journal "B8_MeetVivec" = 50;
