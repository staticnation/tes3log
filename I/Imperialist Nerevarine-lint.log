  |DATA|NAME:I must go to Urshilaku Burial Caverns to retrieve Bonebiter, the bonemold long bow of Sul-Matuul's ancestor, Sul-Senipul. Sul-Matuul says that the Urshilaku Burial Caverns lie to the south-southeast of Urshilaku camp, halfway between the camp and the slopes of Red Mountain. He warns me that Ashlander ancestral spirits guard these burial chambers.

You are an outlander, but the Nerevarine comes to drive all outlanders from Morrowind. How could an outlander be the Incarnate? The Great Houses stole our lands and mocked us with false gods.

  |DATA|NAME:Nibani Maesa says I am not the Nerevarine, but I may become the Nerevarine. It seems she is willing to help me unravel the Nerevarine prophecies and my part in them. She tells me to seek the lost prophecies among the Dissident priests of the Temple. If I bring these lost prophecies to her, she will be my guide. And she gave me copies of the Nerevarine prophecies called 'The Stranger' and 'The Seven Visions'. Now it's time to report back to Caius.|QSTF
