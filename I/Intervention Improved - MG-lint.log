Once I know the locations of some Dwemer ruins, I will be asking you to travel to some dangerous places. This spell should help you to return to the nearest mages guild. It looks like Divine Intervention spell, but on using it instead of taking to you to the Imperial Cult altar, it takes you to the Mages Guild. Pretty neat right. Its my own invention!|SCVR:34JX3MG_ReturnBook|INTV|BNAM:Journal MG_ReturnBook 100  Player->AddSpell "UAH_Mages_Teleport"  ModDisposition 10  ModPCFacRep 5 "Mages Guild"  Player->ModReputation 1
