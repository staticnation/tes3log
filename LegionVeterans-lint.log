  |DATA|ONAM:Arnsa Thendas|NAME:A Droth Dagger?  Yes, he did indeed have one.  Something he'd mentioned to you, I presume?  Well, you're certainly welcome to it.  I don't like weapons, to be honest.  Please take this, and think fondly of Sandas.  I'm sure he'd want you to have it.|SCVR:04JX0MS_EstateSale|INTV:#|SCVR:12sX0Droth_var|INTV:|SCVR:25IX0silver dagger_droth_unique|INTV:|BNAM:player->additem "silver dagger_droth_unique" 1  com_chest_02_thendas1->removeitem "silver dagger_droth_unique" 1  Journal MS_EstateSale 40  set Droth_var to 1

  LegionVeterans.ESP->|DATA|ONAM:pellecia aurrus|NAME:Sorry, I can't help you. Though I am surprised that they only send missionaries out to collect spare coins for the poor and vulnerable. I can't remember the last time they needed the generosity of citizens to fill their coffers when it came to arming the Legion, or finding funds to mine ebony.|SCVR:04JX3IC10_buckmoth_alms|INTV|SCVR:14JX4IC11_shirt|INTV

  |DATA|ONAM:Arnsa Thendas|NAME:Oh, I'm sorry...I had no idea. Sandas always spoke so fondly of his time in the Legion.  I'm sure you must miss him almost as terribly as I do.  Since you were so close, perhaps there's a particular item you'd like to remember him by?  I can afford to part with something before the sale.|SCVR:01500|INTV|BNAM:Journal MS_EstateSale 35

  |DATA|ONAM:caius cosades|NAME:The Imperial Legion has several fort garrisons here on Vvardenfell. The lower ranks handle law enforcement, escorts, rescues, dangerous predators, diseased and blighted beasts, and so forth. Only one fort accepts recruits -- Fort Darius in Gnisis. Gnisis is a frontier outpost, isolated, a little rough. But good experience. If you're interested, see General Darius in Gnisis.|SCVR:04JX3A1_1_FindSpymaster|INTV
