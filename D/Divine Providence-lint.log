  |DATA|ONAM:korst wind-eye|NAME:In three days' time, the victim will become a werewolf himself. During these three days, though, a simple Cure Disease spell can stop the infection. Wait...you have rid yourself of the infection. Thank the All-Maker! You have been true to our people, and the Skaal name you Blodskaal, a blood friend to our people. You will be given a home here, Rigmor Halfhand's former residence, in which you may rest. Also, it has been decided that you will take part in the Ristaag, an important Skaal ceremony.|SCVR:04JX3BM_SkaalAttack|INTV|SCVR:14JX4BM_SkaalAttack|INTV:2|SCVR:23sX0hasdisease|INTV:|BNAM:Journal BM_SkaalAttack 100

  |DATA|ONAM:korst wind-eye|NAME:The infection seems innocent enough. Some weakness, perhaps. Sometimes the effects are hardly noticeable. However, in three days' time, the victim will become a werewolf himself. It is a fate I would not wish upon my greatest foe. During these three days, though, a simple Cure Disease spell can stop the infection. I beg you to do this. Until then, I fear I cannot allow you to be a part of our community, perhaps infecting others. When you have been cured, I hope you will return to us again.|SCVR:04JX3BM_SkaalAttack|INTV|SCVR:14JX4BM_SkaalAttack|INTV:2|BNAM:Journal BM_SkaalAttack 50
