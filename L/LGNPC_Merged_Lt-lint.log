  morrowind.esm------->|DATA|ONAM:artisa arelas|NAME:Hammerfell is primarily an urban and maritime province, with most of its population confined to the great port and trade cities. The interior is sparsely populated with small poor farms and beastherds. The Redguard love of travel, adventure, and the high seas has dispersed them as sailors, mercenaries, and adventurers in ports of call throughout the Empire.|BNAM:;Imperial Legion; Imperial cult; bard, bookseller, savant;
  LGNPC_Merged_Lt.ESP->|DATA|ONAM:alusaron|NAME:If it was not for its strategic position in the Illiac Bay I wonder if the territory of Hammerfell would hold any interest to the Empire. Only a hearty, stubborn people like us Redguards could make a home in its barren interior. Yes, we love the land of our birth if only because it is where my people had once known freedom. We will not cease to contest the Empire until the return of our sovereignty.|BNAM:; LGNPC Foreign Quarter
