The Ascadian Isles is a good place to hunt. I suggest you start by looking around near Balur Salvu's house. He says he sees wild bull netch all the time. Now, stick with bull netch to start with. The betty netch are rather more dangerous.|SCVR:04JX3IC6_Rat|INTV:2|SCVR:14JX4IC7_netch|INTV|BNAM:;Synnolian Tunifus;  Journal IC7_netch 1
  Library of Vivec Overhaul - QuestOnly.esp->|DATA|ONAM|SLF_orunre_termaren|NAME:Greetings, stranger! Welcome to the Library of Vivec! Lord Vivec prides himself with what we have accomplished, and we are proud to serve him by accumulating ever more knowledge. Since you are not a member of the Temple and of a certain rank, we cannot allow you to take any of the books with you, but you are allowed to browse. Please, go right ahead. But remember to remain quiet. We don't want to disturb the scholars, do we?
