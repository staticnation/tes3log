  |DATA|ONAM:plitinius mero|NAME:Helseth is the son of Barenziah, former Queen of Morrowind, who herself was the niece of King Athyn Llethan. It is certain that his bloodline is strong. He is a young king, though, and perhaps a bit rash. He does not yet possess his mother's wisdom or his father's courage.

[DUP-INF]: ID=15323271032745521561(Topic:helseth)
  |DATA|ONAM:effe_tei|NAME:This new ruler, King Hlaalu Helseth, is trying to transform the role of King of Morrowind from a mere Imperial figurehead into a powerful, personalized head of state. Athyn Llethan, the previous king, was old and dignified, but few took him seriously. Helseth, by contrast, is dynamic and ambitious. Before Morrowind entered the Empire, the Dunmer had no kings, and many Dunmer prefer the old system of council rule, but Imperial partisans want a strong king along Western Imperial lines.
