  |DATA|ONAM:danso indules|NAME:What could kill two Ordinators before they can draw their weapons? Slit their throats? Happened right here in Vivec. Must be a sorcerer or vampire. The Office of the Watch in the Hall of Justice is worried about sending their own Ordinators out after this killer. The rumor is that the Office of the Watch is looking for outside help. You're an outlander. Did you know five other outlanders were killed just the same way?|SCVR:06DX0dreamer prophet|INTV:|SCVR:14JX4town_Vivec|INTV:2|BNAM:;Vivec; default; Dunmer;   Journal town_Vivec 1

  |DATA|ONAM:Vedam Dren|NAME:I'm told you claim to be the Incarnate -- Nerevar reborn according to legend. My father used to say, 'When you hear something unbelievable, don't believe it.' From what I hear, your story is remarkable enough without relying on ancient prophecies. I suggest you stand upon your reputation, and leave superstitions to the prophets and holy men.|SCVR:04JX3A2_6_Incarnate|INTV:2
