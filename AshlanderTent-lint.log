  |DATA|CNAM:Warrior|NAME:I'm a warrior by trade. I know how to fight, when necessary, but I much rather look so tough that critters give up or run away when they see me. Personally, I favor long blades of all kinds -- they use long blades of many different styles and craftsmanships here in Morrowind -- and I wear medium armor, for a decent balance of protection and mobility. But I train with various weapon types and armor types. And like any good warrior, I'm my own armorer -- don't want to fight with worn weapons in worn armor.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Warrior; Longblade, Medium Armor, Armorer

  morrowind.esm----->|DATA|CNAM:Merchant|NAME:I am a merchant. I look for goods that are well-made, that people want to buy, that I can buy and sell at a profit. There are many different kinds of materials I can buy and sell -- animal products, vegetable products, mineral products, even exotic products. Crafts and manufactured goods I deal in include weapons, armor, clothing, books, potions, enchanted items, and various housewares. I travel, talk with people I meet, buy what I like, and sell what people like.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Merchant; generic merchants do not have services, and do not buy and sell; they are just merchant quest and scenery characters
  AshlanderTent.esp->|DATA|CNAM:Tent maker|NAME:I am an Ashlander tent maker. I have knowledge of the land and its creatures to create homes that are in harmony with the physical and spiritual world. Through my knowledge of mysticism my works can hold more than meets the eye.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:AddTopic, "Ashlander Tent"
