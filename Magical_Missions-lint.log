  Magical_Missions.ESP->|DATA|ONAM:Arathel|NAME:You could call me a slave, although I'm really just a helping hand. I clean and sweep, but Miss Melona still does the shopping and cooking. The Master paid me a living wage, and allowed me time off for holidays and taking long walks in the woods. I don't know what will happen now. Perhaps I won't be needed.
