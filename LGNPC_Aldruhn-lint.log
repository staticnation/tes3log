  tribunal.esm------>|DATA|NAME:I have returned to Ashmelech and spoken with Daunayne Aundae. She was pleased with how I handled the killing of Ano Vando, and rewarded me with an amulet that, when used, will return me to Ashmelech. She has also told me that I might find further reward with her if I am able to kill a great number of the vampires from other clans.|QSTF
  LGNPC_Aldruhn.esp->|DATA|NAME:I have asked whether the vampire hunter is a Dunmer with a scar on his right chin, and Dhaunayne confirmed it. This means that he is Ano Vando, the warrior I killed earlier. Dhaunayne was happy to hear it, but it was a pity that her plan to make him a lesson to other vampire hunters wouldn't work now. Nonetheless, she rewarded me with an amulet that, when used, will return me to Ashmelech. She has also informed me that killing a great number of vampires from other clans may bring me further reward.|QSTF
