  |DATA|ONAM:galero andaram|NAME:Welcome to our little Almsivi chapel. Pardon our informal surroundings, but we are guests here of House Telvanni, and apparently they have no more spacious, well-lit accommodations available for the Temple faithful. Still, we have all the services you'd expect to find a much larger Temple.|SCVR:01630|INTV:
