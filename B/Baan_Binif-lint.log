  morrowind.esm-->|DATA|ONAM:sul-matuul|NAME:Kogoruhn was an ancient Dunmer stronghold. Here. Let me mark it on your map. Go by day, in good weather, or you may miss your way. Follow the coast east from Urshilaku camp to the ruined Dunmer stronghold called Valenvaryon, then turn southwest. You'll see Ebernanit, a ruined Daedric shrine. Continue south from Ebernanit to Kogoruhn, a great table of stone with many ruined buildings. There are many rooms. The passages are old and deep. Beneath are caves with pools of fire. It is a bad place. Go prepared.|SCVR:04JX3A2_6_Incarnate|INTV|BNAM:ShowMap Kogoruhn  ShowMap Valenvaryon
