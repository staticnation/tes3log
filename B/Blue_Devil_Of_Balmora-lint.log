  |DATA|ONAM:chargen captain|NAME:Balmora is north of Seyda Neen. The road passes Pelagiad village and Fort Pelagiad, crosses a deep ravine, passes Fort Moonmoth, then turns west across the Odai River and into Balmora. The South Wall cornerclub is in southeast Balmora, on the east side of the river. For more detailed directions, talk to Elone the Scout at Arrille's Tradehouse here in Seyda Neen. But take my advice. You're new here. Take the silt strider to Balmora. Fast, cheap, safe. Cross the bridge and head east. Can't miss it.|BNAM:ShowMap Balmora  ShowMap Pelagiad  ShowMap "Moonmoth Legion Fort"
