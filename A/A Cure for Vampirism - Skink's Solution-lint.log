  morrowind.esm------------------------------->|DATA|NAME:I have spoken to Molag Bal through his statue in the shrine at Bal Ur. He tells me that he does not have the cure for my vampirism, but he will get it for me if I do him a favor. His daughter, Molag Grunda, has been consorting with a Frost Atronach named Nomeg Gwai. If I can kill the two of them, returning their souls to a realm where Molag Bal may punish them, Molag Bal will give me the cure. They live now in the cave Dubdilla, south of Vos.

  tribunal.esm-------------------------------->|DATA|NAME:I have found a some papers by a Buoyant Armiger, Galur Rithari. In them, he gives hints as to how vampirism may be cured. It suggests that the cure may be obtained with the help of a Daedra Prince, perhaps Molag Bal.

  |DATA|CNAM:Sorcerer|NAME:I don't know whether vampirism is a disease. And if it is a disease, I don't know if it can be cured, or how. But I have heard rumors of a cure for vampirism. And I recall reading a reference in a rare local book that might be useful. Look for a book called 'Vampires of Vvardenfell, Volume II.' It might be hard to find here. It was suppressed by the Temple. But I recall reading something there about a Buoyant Armiger who became a vampire, but who was cured.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;default NON-DUNMER;PC Vampire; mage; sorcerer;
