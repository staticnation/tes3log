And you have no way to prove this statement? I scarcely know what to think. If true, I can't begin to imagine what the social and political consequences would be. But I doubt you'd be very popular among the Dunmer if this were known. My advice is to keep quiet about this. I certainly shall. I have heard nothing whatsoever from you about this. And we have not spoken. Understand?|SCVR:21500|INTV|BNAM:goodbye
