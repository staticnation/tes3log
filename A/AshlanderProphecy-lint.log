  tribunal.esm---------->|DATA|ONAM:Relur Faryon|NAME:What could kill two Ordinators before they can draw their weapons? Slit their throats? Happened right here in Vivec. Must be a sorcerer or vampire. The Office of the Watch in the Hall of Justice is worried about sending their own Ordinators out after this killer. The rumor is that the Office of the Watch is looking for outside help. You're an outlander. Did you know five other outlanders were killed just the same way?|SCVR:06DX0dreamer prophet|INTV:|SCVR:14JX4town_Vivec|INTV:2|BNAM:;Vivec; default; Dunmer;   Journal town_Vivec 1
