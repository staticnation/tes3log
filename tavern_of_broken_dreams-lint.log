  morrowind.esm--------------->|DATA|CNAM:Mage|NAME:I am a mage. My study is the destruction and alteration of the visible and invisible world. I study magic for its pure intellectual challenge and rewards, but I am paid in gold for the practical applications of my knowledge. Further, when undertaking expeditions in search of knowledge, I defend myself with spells of the College of Destruction, and leap, swim, and levitate with the spells of the College of Alteration.|SCVR:0CsX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Mage; Destruction, Alteration
