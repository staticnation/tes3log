  tribunal.esm---------->|DATA|ONAM:King Hlaalu Helseth|NAME:The attacks were Almalexia's doing? She murders Sotha Sil, and then tries to kill you as well. Astounding! With Vivec dead as well, this is truly the end of the Tribunal. I believe your tale, %PCName, but do not expect my people to be so accepting of it. You will find it is not so easy to kill these gods in the hearts and minds of their followers. It will take time, but this will be a new era for Morrowind, and I will lead them into it. You have done well, my friend. You have my gratitude.|SCVR:04JX3TR_SothaSil|INTV:n|SCVR:16DX2vivec_god|INTV:|BNAM:Journal TR_Champion 110  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_boots" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_cuirass" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_gauntlet_left" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_gauntlet_right" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_greaves" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_Helmet" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_pauldron_left" 1  Player->AddItem "Helsethguard_pauldron_right" 1
