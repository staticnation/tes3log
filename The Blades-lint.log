Can I make a suggestion? Go see Wayn at the Balmora Guild of Fighters. Know what a jink blade is? It has a Paralyze enchantment. And a spider blade has a Poison enchantment. They're not considered honorable weapons, and most smiths don't sell them. But they sure come in handy.|SCVR:01065|INTV|BNAM:journal blades_Gildan 1

  |DATA|ANAM:Vos|NAME:Vos is an old Velothi farm village in the Grazelands. Dunmer have farmed here for centuries. Life's never been easy, and the Ashlanders have always raided and stolen our wickwheat and marshmerrow. But our new Telvanni mage-lord, Master Aryon of Tel Vos, protects us from the Ashlanders, and he's grown us a fine new tradehouse and docks. Tel Vos is Master Aryon's wizard's tower. It's very strange. You have to see it to understand. Master Aryon isn't afraid to try new things.|BNAM:ShowMap Vos  ;Vos ;
