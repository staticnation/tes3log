  |DATA|ONAM:brallion|NAME:The Dark Elves have traditionally permitted enslavement of Humans, Orcs, Argonians, and Khajiit, and mistreatment of these races is not recognized as a crime, other than as a crime against property. Slavery is not now practiced in Summerset Isles or Valenwood, and its practice is on the wane in Morrowind. By terms of the Armistice, Morrowind defines its own laws and customs, and slavery remains legal. Slavery is uncommon in Redoran and Hlaalu Districts, common in Telvanni, Indoril, and Dres Districts.|BNAM:;Dunmer;

They are the greatest things that Sleeper agents and Dreamers especially can aspire to be. On a hierarchical level, the Ascended sleeper Dagoth priests rank just below the Heartwight Kin.

In the First Age, House Dagoth betrayed the other Great Houses during the War of the First Council and was destroyed for their treason. It is a common misconception that House Dwemer and House Dagoth were allies. This is only partially true. The Sixth House was, in the general Chimer world view, the Scapegoat, the Shadow, and variably the Serpent of the old Chimer Mythos.
