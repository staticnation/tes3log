That was the case until we painstakingly dug it back out in secret. As I'm sure you're aware, the eggmine is just a front for our smuggling operation. We can move goods, money, or even people through the mountains, and our rivals are none the wiser. The trade route from Kragenmoor to Narsis is too saturated with spies to sneak anything through. Luckily, our secret is safe with me.
