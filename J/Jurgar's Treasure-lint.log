  tribunal.esm---------->|DATA|ANAM:Balmora|NAME:Everyone knows the Balmora magistrate, Nolus Atrius, is on the take. Thieves, thugs, and murderers are getting ridiculous sentences, or paying a drake and walking free. But they'll never get Atrius. He's got fatcats and family back in the City to cover him. The Legion Champion, Larrius Varro, over at Moonmoth Legion Fort, he has sworn an oath to stop corruption. But I don't see what he can do.|SCVR:04JX4town_balmora|INTV|SCVR:12sX4Random100|INTV:2|SCVR:2CsX0nolore|INTV:|BNAM:; balmora;   Journal town_balmora 1

  |DATA|ANAM:Balmora|NAME:They say someone hit the Camonna Tong at the Council Club. Hard. And the guards SAY they're very concerned, and they're following all leads... But somehow they don't seem very sincere. And Larrius Varro? Champion at Fort Moonmoth? He's been quoted as saying, 'I swore an oath to stop corruption, but it seems the gods have seen fit to fulfill my oath for me.' And you know what's funny? Someone said they saw YOU talking to Larrius Varro several times recently. A coincidence? I don't think so.|SCVR:04JX3town_balmora|INTV|SCVR:1CsX0nolore|INTV
