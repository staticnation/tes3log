  morrowind.esm--------------------------->|DATA|CNAM:Savant|NAME:Slavery is protected by law in Morrowind. Slavery is illegal throughout the Empire, and considered barbaric. Slavery had disappeared in Sumerset Isles and Valenwood long before their incorporation into the Empire. Most Imperial citizens assume the practice will die out as Morrowind adopts Imperial ways, and the subject excites little passion except among Argonian and Khajiit abolitionists, outraged that the Empire does little to suppress persistent illegal cross-border slave raiding in southern Morrowind.|SCVR:03sX0NoLore|INTV:|BNAM:;Imperial Legion;
