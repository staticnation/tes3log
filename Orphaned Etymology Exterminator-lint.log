  morrowind.esm----------------------->|DATA|ONAM:maela kaushad|NAME:Corprus is a rare form of blight disease. Sometimes crusaders get it from fighting corprus monsters inside the Ghostfence. We can't cure it. Victims are sent to the Corprusarium beneath Tel Fyr, the tower of the Telvanni wizard Divayth Fyr. Victims go mad, and the body becomes fat and distorted with unnatural growths. It is always fatal. Sometimes it progresses slowly, sometimes in a matter of days.
