Such a long-term mission will be quite expensive -- 1000 drakes is a bare minimum. We're concerned that we haven't received the money he pledged, and that he does not reply to our correspondence. We wish you to go to him in the East Empire Company Hall in Ebonheart and persuade him to provide us with the generous pledge as he promised.|SCVR:04JX3IC13_rich|INTV:2|SCVR:14JX4IC14_Ponius|INTV|BNAM:;Iulus Truptor  Journal IC14_Ponius 1
